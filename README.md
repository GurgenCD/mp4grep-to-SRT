# mp4grep-to-SRT
Simple Javascript function that turns the madeup transcription syntax generated by mp4grep into an SRT syntax compliant file

# Usage
CD to the root folder of the script using a command line, and execute
> node main.js
followed by a full name of the file, for example:
> node main.js test.transcribed.txt

After a short while, the script will create two different files:
1. The generated .srt version of the script
2. Text only .txt file

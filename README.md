# mp4grep-to-SRT
Simple Javascript function that turns the madeup transcription syntax generated by mp4grep, into a functional .srt file

# Usage
CD to the root folder of the script, and type
> node main.js *name of the mp4grep generated .txt file*

After a short while, the script will create two different files:
1. The generated .srt version of the script
2. Text only .txt file
